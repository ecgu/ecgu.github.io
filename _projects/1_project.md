This is a page for Introduction to Sociocultural Anthropology (ANTH2A) with James Egan. Here you will find information and materials that are necessary for the course, but will be helpful if you want a good score and develop skills that will help you through your college experience and beyond. If the information is not on Canvas, it will be here.

#### Teaching Section
My teaching section is Tuesdays 5-7 PM at HICF 100L, in the little boxes south of the Science Library. We will go over materials for upcoming exams and essays using the study guide and answer other questions people may have. If you would like to speak one-on-one with me, don't hesitate to email me to schedule office hours, which will default be held near the end of the teaching section. If that time doesn't work for you, then we can work something else out.

Office hours are a space where you can ask me for any academic or professional advice: not just questions about the course, but also advice on resumes, applying to grad school, finding resources for disability assistance on campus, and more. Please don't hesitate to reach out!

#### On Scantrons
The tests and essays for this course require the use of scantron forms. These forms can be unintuitive to use these days, so if it is your first time taking a text with one, it'd be helpful to check out this guide of what to look out for.
