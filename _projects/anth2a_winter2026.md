This is a page for Introduction to Sociocultural Anthropology (ANTH2A) with James Egan. I am one of six TAs that are here to ensure that you succeed in this course. Here you will find information and materials that are not required for the course, but will be helpful if you want a good score and develop skills that will help you through your college experience and beyond. If the information is not on Canvas, it will be here. More will be added in the coming weeks!

    A Somoan canoe (va'a) in Newport Bay. In the 1960s at the height of American counterculture, UC Irvine had an experimental program called the <a href="[https://calisphere.org/collections/192/]">Social Sciences Farm</a> which involved inviting people from around the world to demonstrate and teach their crafts. This canoe is still displayed in the Social Science Tower today. What do you think the goals and ideas from that moment in history that made this event possible? What were it's problems and limitations?

#### Teaching Section

My teaching section is Tuesdays 5-7 PM at HICF 100L, in the little boxes south of the Science Library. We will go over materials for upcoming exams and essays using the study guide and answer other questions people may have. Teaching sections are optional for this course, but will be helpful for the otherwise difficult tests.

#### Office Hours

If you would like to speak one-on-one with me, I will have office hours that by default will be held near the end of the teaching section at HICF 100L. If that time doesn't work for you, then we can work something else out. In either case, please email me ahead of time so I can plan accordingly.

Office hours are a space where you can ask me for any academic or professional advice: not just questions about the course, but also advice on resumes, applying to grad school, finding resources for disability assistance on campus, concerns about student or faculty conduct, and more. Please don't hesitate to reach out!

#### Weeks
##### Week 2
- Slides from today can be found here.
- On Brazil and Japan in the study guide: see the textbook for more info on their relevance to the course.

##### Week 3
- We will go over some of the key terms from the lectures so far and practice writing from one of the essay prompts.

#### On Scantrons

The tests and essays for this course require the use of scantron forms. These forms can be unintuitive to use these days, so if it is your first time taking a test with one, it'd be helpful to look up on YouTube how to fill one in and what common mistakes are. This may save a lot of potential headache for you and the test graders.

#### Suggestions

If you have suggestions for what else to do during teaching sections or anything else interesting that is related to the course that you'd wish to share with me or others in the class, let me know! Any other helpful resources and links you find will be put here.
